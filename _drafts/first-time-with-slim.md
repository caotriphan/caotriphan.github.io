More details at [slim lang](http://slim-lang.com/)

### What i've known so far

- [Emmet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmet_(software)), its syntax quite similar to slim so the first time not suprise met a lots.
- [Razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASP.NET_Razor), helps me a lots when combine dynamic code with static code in view
- Strong knowledge in html/css, yeah, no doubt.
